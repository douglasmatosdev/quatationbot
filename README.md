# Solving problems
There is a mismatch between the documentation and the latest release of the botbuilder package (version 4.0.6) features / methods. Microsoft has changed some of the legacy features of the botbuilder npm package, but they haven't updated their doc yet!

The JavaScript code which is present in [Microsoft's Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/nodejs/bot-builder-nodejs-quickstart?view=azure-bot-service-3.0) won't work for the same reason!

Try with the botbuilder package version 3.13.1 , it will work perfectly.

To Install:
npm i -S botbuilder@3.13.1
